### Project Title
Exploring US bikeshare data from three major cities

### Description

The goal of the project is to help user to understand more about the bikeshare data from three major US cities: Chicago, NYC and Washington.

Initially, users are prompted to answer how they want to filter the data. Briefly, they can choose to filter the data based on city, month, and/or day of the week.

Then according to user input, statistic analysis of the data is presented including but not limited to :

1) The busiest month, day of the week and time to travel.
2) The busiest train station.
3) Passenger's gender and age info.

Finally, we ask user if they would like to see the raw data. If so, the raw data are presented.
